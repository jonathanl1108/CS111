lab1b-client.c:
    A C program implementation that allows the follwing options

    --log = filename : crete a file that trace the data that are send and receieved through the network 
        with format SENT # bytes: or RECEIVED # bytes:
    --compress :compression to reduce the amount of space data takes up asssit with zlib 
      compression and decompression

lab1b-server.c:
     A C program implementation that allows the follwing options
        --port= portnumber : specify the port number for the server
        --compress :compression to reduce the amount of space data takes up asssit with zlib 
        compression and decompression
        --shell creates a new process throught thr fork command, where the child process execute a /bin/bash

    * read input from the shell pipe and write it to stdout. 
        1)If it receives an <lf> from the shell, it should print it to the screen as <cr><lf>.
