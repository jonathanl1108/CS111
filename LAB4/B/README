lab4b.c: 
	A C program that is supported by beaglebone which will report the temperature and
	output the time in the form hr:min:sec tempertur(C/F)
	the program supports the following options 
	--period= time : allows the user to decided the frequency of temperature report in seconds 
	--scale=[C/F]  : the temperature report is by default using F, and can be change by --scale=C
	--log=file name : allows the user to stdout to a specific file 
	
	Upon the options, the program will also monitor STDIN and process the following keywords 
	SCALE=F
		This command will change the reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.
	SCALE=C
		This command will change the reports to be generated in degrees C
	PERIOD=seconds
		This command should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals
	STOP
		This command should cause the program to stop generating reports
	START
		This command should let the command to resume if once stopped 
	LOG 
		Takes no action in lab4b
		
	OFF
		Same effects as pressing the button, which will let the program ended 
check.sh:
	a python shell script that will do a series of smoke test for lab4b.c 
	

Makefile:
	build: gcc -o lab4b -g -lm -lmraa -Wall -Wextra lab4b.c
	check: runs a test program test.sh for standard smoke test 
	clean: removes lab4b and tar file
	dist: creates a tar ball that consist:
			Makefile
			lab4b.c
			README
			check.sh
